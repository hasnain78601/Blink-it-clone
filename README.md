This is a simple e-commerce product page inspired by Blinkit. It comes with a clean design, a fixed header with a search bar, and a shopping cart. You can browse through various products, add them to the cart, and see the cart count update in real time.

The page is fully responsive, so it looks good on both mobile and desktop. Thereâ€™s also an ad banner at the top to give it a real-world feel, though it might stretch a little on larger screens. The product cards have a nice hover effect, making them a bit more interactive.
